Data
1) Really high frequency signal. It's hard to reduce the segment length without losing a lot of information. Maybe smoothing and sampling with a lower period? Or Maybe low-pass filter? And resampling?
2) Really long sequences, and great variability between lengths.
	First mouse: From 3000 samples (with period 2 ms) to 1368500 samples.
		Average is ~30918
		stdev = 64994.
	Second mouse: from 500 samples to 1254000 samples.
		Average: 41167
		stdev: 104343 
3) Remember to divide the segments randomly... Done
4) Extremely low accuracy with only a LSTM layer (~47%), mostly due to the format of the data? (I think so)

5 seconds max.

For each sequence: first 10 seconds
other

50 train
20 validation
30 test
then k-fold 10 split, 4/5 1/5 train validation. test on everything.

Transitions:
sleep-awake	-> 0
awake-seep	-> 1
sleep-rem	-> 2
rem-awake	-> 3
